Solution


#Whenever the Python interpreter reads a source file, it does two things: it sets a few special variables like __name__, and then it executes all of the code found in the file.
#Take integer input from the user.
a = int(raw_input())
b = int(raw_input())
#defined varaible with a+b
x = a+b
#defined varaible with a-b
y = a-b
#defined varaible with y+x
z = a*b
#print output
print x
#print output
print y
#print output
print z
