Solution

# the __future__ module is used to make functionality available in the current version of Python even though it will only be officially introduced in a future version.
from __future__ import division

# it sets a few special variables like __name__, and then it executes all of the code found in the file.
if __name__ == '__main__':
  # The "input" function converts the input you enter as if it were python code. "raw_input" doesn't convert the input and takes the input as it is given.

    a = int(raw_input())
    b = int(raw_input())

a = 4
b = 3

print(a//b)

# float Numbers written with a decimal point dividing the integer and fractional parts
print float (a / b)
