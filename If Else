Python If-Else

Task
Given an integer, *n* , perform the following conditional actions:
If <i>n<i> is odd, print Weird
If n is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, print Not Weird
If n is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, print Weird
If n is even and greater than , print Not Weird

#!/bin/python

# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN (standard out). When you run your Python program, sys.stdin is the file object connected to standard input (STDIN). Print output to STDOUT
N = int(raw_input())

Solution
# A number is even if it is perfectly divisible by 2. When the number is divided by 2, we use the remainder operator % to compute the remainder. If the remainder is not zero, the number is odd.
if N % 2 == 1: print("Weird")
# The elif statement allows you to check multiple expressions for TRUE and execute a block of code as soon as one of the conditions evaluates to TRUE.
# >= If the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand, then condition becomes true and with >= if the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.
elif N % 2 == 0 and N >=2 and N <=5: print("Not Weird")
elif N % 2 == 0 and N >=6 and N <=20: print("Weird")
elif N % 2 == 0 and N > 20: print("Not Weird")
