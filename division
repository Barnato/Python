Python: Division

Task
Read two integers and print two lines.

The first line should contain integer division,  a // b. The second line should contain float division,  / .
You don't need to perform any rounding or formatting operations.

Solution:

# __future__ is a pseudo-module which programmers can use to enable new language features which are not compatible with the current interpreter. 

#if_name_ is a variable '_main_' is hard coded strong assigned by interpt to variables. Once variables set up the interp executives code in the module, one statement at a time. vVriables are storage placeholder for text and numbers, variable is always assigned with the equal sign followed by the value of the variable


if __name__ == '__main__':
    a = int(raw_input())
    b = int(raw_input())



a = 4
b = 3


print(a//b)

print float (a/b)
