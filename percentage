Average %

Finding the percentage

You have a record of N students. Each record contains the student's name, and their percent marks in Maths, Physics and Chemistry. The marks can be floating values. The user enters some integer N followed by the names and marks for students. You are required to save the record in a dictionary data type. The user then enters a student's name. Output the average percentage marks obtained by that student, correct to two decimal places.

    #reads a line from input, in this case the number of students, n is the variable name, number of students
    n = int(raw_input())
    #this creates a dictionary to store the student scores
    student_marks = {}
    for _ in range(n):
        #creates a list divided based on spaces in input
        line = raw_input().split()
        #creates new dictionary values, with name coming from first position, and scores taken from the next position unil end of of row
        name, scores = line[0], line[1:]
        #converts score strings to floating point numbers (integer plus fraction), creates list of results
        scores = map(float, scores)
        student_marks[name] = scores
 #takes user input for which student to look at so we know which student's average to return
    query_name = raw_input()
    #creates new variable which stores the scores for the student whose name was inputted
    marks = student_marks[query_name]
    #takes average of a student's scores, and this student whose scores are going to be averaged has been previosuly defined by the user input, query_name = raw_input(). So the selected student's average is returned and printed, to 2 decimal places.
    print("%.2f"%(sum(marks)/3))
