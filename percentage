Average %

Find the percentage

You have a record of N students. Each record contains the student's name, and their percent marks in Maths, Physics and Chemistry. The marks can be floating values. The user enters some integer N followed by the names and marks for students. You are required to save the record in a dictionary data type. The user then enters a student's name. Output the average percentage marks obtained by that student, correct to two decimal places.

   #reads a line from input, in this case the number of students, n is the variable name, number of students
    n = int(input())
   #this creates a dictionary to store the student scores

    for _ in range(n):
        name, *line = input().split()
        scores = list(map(float, line))
        student_marks[name] = scores
        #takes user input for which student to look at so we know which student's average to return
    query_name = input()

x = sum(student_marks[query_name])/len(scores)
#formats to 2 decimals points
print('%.2f' % x)
